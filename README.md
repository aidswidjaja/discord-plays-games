# discord-plays-games

![Example](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This bot will allow you to play games with your friends in discord sorta like [twitch plays pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon). It does this by sending the keyboard commands typed in chat to the game of your choice (game must have a screenshot key. Pause and resume keys are helpful but not required).

# How to use
1. Make a discord bot and get a discord token. [See here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
2. Download this repo
